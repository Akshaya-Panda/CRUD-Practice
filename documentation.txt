1)	Create a directory and named it as master.
mkdir master
cd master
cd tmdc
git clone https://github.com/techm-dc/devicefarmer-stf.git
cd devicefarmer-stf
git checkout ios-wda-api-automation
python3 –-version
pyenv install 3.8.10
pyenv install 2.7.18
pyenv local 3.8.10 2.7.18
python3 –version -> python 3.8.10
python2 –version -> python 2.7.18
nvm use 8
npm i
brew services list
brew install rethinkdb
sudo find / -type d -name 'rethinkdb_data'
go the folder where rethinkdb_data is
then create a file named intance1.conf
nano instance1.conf 
inside the file we have to write bind=all
brew services start rethinkdb
brew services list
we can see now the rethinkdb is in running state
nvm use 8 
stf migrate
npm link –force
cd ../..
git clone https://github.com/techm-dc/tmss-scripts
cd tmss-scripts
brew install nginx
after that go the path /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx
here nginx.conf file will be there 
we we will add include /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/conf.d/*.coanf;
we will make one directory there
mkdir conf.d
cd conf.d
nano localdeploy.conf
here we will paste the contents of master server and will change the url of the master server and the location and the ip corresponding to the master.
the we will go the tmdc folder here we will make the stf-ssl-certs .
inside the stf-ssl-certs we will make the fullchain and private.pem files 
and after that we will run the command nginx -t . our nginx configuration should be successfull. If our nginx configuration is failed we have to do the debugging according to that.
then we will start the nginx by the command 
brew services start nginx
our nginx should be successfully started in the background.

Then we will go the tmss-scripts folder under the master folder . In that we will go the tmdcsecure .
cd master/tmss-scripts/tmdcsecure
we have to change the tmdc_deploy.env file with the specific contents ..we have to change the tmdc_url, ip address, saml_entry point and the save the file .
after that we will change the stf-ecosystem.config.js file we have to change the path there we have to put the correct path of the devicefarmer-stf which is under the master/ytmdc/devicefarmer-stf and have to change the app url and the ip address in the whole file and have to add the app-url in the provider and the stf-api.
And have to change the saml entry point url in the stf-auth-3000 and the path to the saml.crt.
We have create a cert folder under the master/tmdc/cert/saml.crt.

Then we will start the stf-ecosystemconfig.js by running the command
pm2 start st-ecosystemconfig.js 
we can see now all the services are running .

In the other terminal we will now go the iosprovider-ecosystemconfig.js file and have to do the changes by changing the tmdc url and the ip address and in the rethinkdb we will add 127.0.0.1 and will save it and will run the iosprovider by running the pm2 start iosprovider-ecosystemconfig.js and and in the other terminal where our stf-ecosystem.js is running we will delete all the services and then again we will start 
pm2 delete all ; pm2 start stf-ecosystemconfig.js then we can see the ios-provider service is running with all the services and we can check the UI .
if the UI is still not loaded .. then we will go the tmdc folder 
cd master/tmdc/devicefarmer-stf
nvm ls
nvm use 12
npm run prepare
then we will check the UI , we can see the UI will be loading and the device is in use state now.
